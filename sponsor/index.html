    TPP is a global health IT company, working on cutting-edge technology to transform lives across the world. They work on pioneering products, including digital health software, apps, and ground-breaking research. TPP need problem solvers from all disciplines to help them move healthcare forward.
  </p>
  <p>
    TPP have had great success in the UK, with over 5,500 organisations using their system to support over 50 million patient records. In recent years, TPP has expanded internationally to tackle global health challenges. The Analyst, Communications and Account teams regularly travel internationally, most recently to China and the Middle East. The technical teams also have the opportunity to travel. During these trips, staff have the time to go sightseeing and sample local cuisine.
  </p>
    <p>
      It’s not just TPP’s products that are revolutionary – they’ve also broken the mould in terms of company culture. TPP recognise the potential that each graduate has from the moment they start, and use that talent to work on exciting projects and challenges. An employee’s value at the company isn’t based on how long they’ve been there – TPP operates on a flat hierarchy, so staff can make a difference and work on new projects from the moment they start. TPP listen to their employees and have changed the way they work based on feedback, meaning their staff can be empowered to make a difference. As a result, TPP have been consistently recognised as an outstanding graduate employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2014 and 2015 they placed first in The Sunday Times 100 Best Small Companies To Work For and were named Top Company For Graduates To Work For in 2016/17 and 2017/18 by The JobCrowd. Most recently, they were in the top 100 Graduate Employers in 2018 by The Times.TPP also offer one of the most competitive graduate salaries on the market and won the ‘Best Graduate Salary’ award from The JobCrowd last year. They provide an excellent starting salary with outstanding annual pay reviews with the graduate salary increasing rapidly during the employee’s time at the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      TPP’s hands-on training approach means new employees will have plenty of responsibility from day one, with great support from the team around them, so applicants don’t need to have any prior experience – coding or otherwise. A bright graduate who is full of ideas and likes spending time with some of the sharpest minds around will be well suited to a career with TPP.
